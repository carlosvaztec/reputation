# Build Your Reputation

This project is an attempt to create a trustworthy, verifiable, and long-lasting digital *reputation* for service providers.

Have you ever tried to find a service provider that you could *trust*? 

What if you could use a mobile app to build trust by verifying a service provider's reputation and the reputation of their clients? That does not sound very easy, but that is what this project is all about.

## Why?

**Users** can be sure the provider exists and is a real human or company.

**Users** can analyze service provider reputation and its client reputation.

**Providers** can build a reputation by making an **impact**, creating value, and being reviewed.

**Starknet** needs a generic **Attestation Service** (inspired by EAS).

**Entities** can **use** AS **data** to drive initiatives:
  - create tools
  - allocate funds (public/private)
  - measure the real impact on real users
